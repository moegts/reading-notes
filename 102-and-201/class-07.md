### Functions, Methods & Objects
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 

- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
