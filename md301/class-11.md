# Mongo and Mongoose

## five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:-

| SQL         | NoSQL                        |
| :--------------: | :------------------:    |
| Relational Databases | non-relational |
| table based databases | document based |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| structured query language | Not Only structured query language |

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

      SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

- Give a real world example.

      Oracle Express Edition

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

      JSON data.

- Give a real world example.

      MongoDB

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

      NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

- Which type of database is best for scalability?

      SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

- What does SQL stand for?

      Structured Query Language

- What is a realational database?

     A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?

     The standard user and application program interface (API) of a relational database is the Structured Query Language. SQL

- What is a ‘schema’?
     is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases).

- What is a NoSQL database?
     A NoSQL [originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational"](1) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

- How does it work?
     t has collections (~ a table in SQL). Collections store data records as documents (~ a row in SQL). Documents don’t have to use the same schema.

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
     Collections and documents that contain data.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
     MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- - -

     NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). ...

- - -

     In order to support ACID developers will have to implement their own code, making their systems more complex. ...

- - -

    NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL.
